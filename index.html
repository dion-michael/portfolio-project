                        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>I started drinking coffee when I was seven years old, in my grandmother’s kitchen. Coffee had been at the center of my life ever since. I was sitting in his old office one day, thinking about how much I wanted to have my own business. I was also thinking how much I’d really like to have a good cup of coffee. My friends, Dion, Fadli, Janto and Agus, had the sense to see that these dreams weren’t mutually exclusive, and suggested opening a coffeehouse. And we did. In February 2015, The “Coffee Break” Coffee Shop opened its doors. Our company has grown into one of the largest specialty coffee roasters in the Indonesia on the back bone of our reputation for the quality, freshness, and unmatched customer service.</p>
                    <div class="bottom-border">
                        <h2>Our Place</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>The “Coffee Break” Coffee Shop sits on the corner of Kebayoran Lama in Jakarta, Indonesia. It’s a big space, with twelve-foot high ceilings, local artist exhibitions, and huge storefront windows that invite sunshine in. We seat about 50 people at tables, chairs, booster seats, and comfy sofas, and, as soon the weather warms up, we spill onto the street as a sidewalk café.
                        <br><br>Everything we do and serve at the Coffee Break is on display. What we brew, bake, grill, or pour is all right in front of our customers. The description we hear most often about the Coffee Break is that it’s a warm, friendly place. We believe, and hope that we live up to our mission statement, which describes Coffee Break as ‘an easy and familiar space, where everyone is welcome.’</p>
                    <div class="bottom-border">
                        <h2>Roasting</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>We roast our coffees separately by origin and type. Full City roast, taking the coffee into the second crack, is our standard and most popular roast. We also roast Aceh, Ijen, Bali and Toraja each of which gets progressively darker. Light roast is available upon request. 
                        <br><br>When blending, we combine the beans after they've cooled in a large mixer and spin them to ensure the different varieties and in many cases different roast profiles get fully integrated. Similar to the approach a fine wine maker uses when blending, we want to make sure each component is contributing distinctive and desirable characteristics to the blend.  We specialize in helping our customers develop and maintain exclusive blend recipes that distinguish their coffee shops and restaurants from the competition.</p>

                                <p class="description">We do: Sit. Stay. Enjoy. That’s it.  We don’t care who you vote for, pray to, or sleep with. We don’t even care if you’re talking on your cell phone while ordering, just as long as we get the gist of what you’d like.</p>

                                <p class="description">We try hard to make this a great place to work, but employees do move on — so we encourage anyone interested in working with us to take a few minutes to read over what we ask of our baristas and full out our online application. </p>

We also provide free coffee grounds for composting to our customers throughout the spring, summer, and fall. We can’t stand waste and overflowing dumpsters.</p>
